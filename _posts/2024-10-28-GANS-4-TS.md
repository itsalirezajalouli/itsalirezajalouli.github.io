Why the hell should we use "GANs" for time-series data when we alredy have these beautiful Autoregression models that are working more than fine? well turns out they're not. 

The problem with Autoregression Forecasting is the fact that these models always are trying to make paternal connections with previous timestamps and therefore AR models are not genuinely generative or probabilistic because they introduce no actual randomness. They are not predicting the same way we humans do, they do not consider the fact their prediction is just a probability, they are just infering patterns like they're 100% sure their prediction happen and when it doesn't they try to find out why and reconfigure themselves accordingly.

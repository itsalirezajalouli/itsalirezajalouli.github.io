Hello World! Huh. I'm posting this from my terminal! in my favorite editor: Neovim...

I like sharing what I learn... so... I guess this is what i'm gonna do in this blog from now on.

I started programming less than a year ago. I was in pain, it was my only scape goat, I was depressed and broken but... for some reason after university, tired and torn apart, instead of being sad and lazzy I just opened CS50 and started learning python:

```python
print('Hello World!')
```
Yeah I know I know... I use single quotation, that's what superior men do. 

after a while i was wondering where am I going with this, why am I learning this shit(sorry for cursing)? one day I saw one of my friends and told him i'm learning python, he was one of the only people who smiled at me at that time. He motivated my ass to learning more. I really love that guy to death.

Anyway, I took a machine learning book and started learning the basics, the curiousity grew and I went on and on and got deeper. I got intorduced to deep learning and I had an internship in uni working with image processing and CNNs last summer. that took me a while but i came out of that internship with a lot of practical knowledge about image processing and also a GUI software.

I also learnt Rust this summer:
```rust
fn main() {
  println!("Hello World")
}
```

I can't be a superior man in rust though it only takes double quotations for strings, single quotations are for characters.

After all now i'm back to deep learning and I'm working on more complex structures like GANs and AutoEncoders. I have a chance to prove myself to be a part of a great project and I tell you now, I'm gonna make it.

I'll update you. bye for now.

# Intro
To be honest I haven't felt the motivation I had when started my journey in
programming and deep learning in a long time.
Now I want to try a new project, something **FUN** and interesting.

Ever since one of my favorite friends, "Mehdi" introduced me to gpt3 two years
ago I was very interested in knowing how they work and they are designed...

I wanted to know how they think?! do they think at all??? well IN ORDER TO
scratch that specific itch in my brain I started ML and then fell into the arms
of DL and been suffocating in computer vision for a while, now it's time for a
fresh start, hence I'm starting a new project and I'll be happy if you want to 
join me to.

The project is: Building a Large Language Model from scratch.

# Intro
I haven't felt the motivation I had wehn started my journey with in a long time.
Now I want to try a new project, something big and interesting, ever since one
of my favorite people, "Mehdi" introduced me to gpt3 2 years ago I was very 
interested in knowing how they work and they are designed.

I wanted to know how they think?! do they think at all??? well to answer that 
I am starting a project: Building a Large Language Model from scratch.

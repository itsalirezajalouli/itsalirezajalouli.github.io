# Intro
To be honest I haven't felt the motivation I had when started my journey in
programming and deep learning in a long time.
Now I want to try a new project, something **FUN** and interesting.

Ever since one of my favorite friends, "Mehdi" introduced me to gpt3 two years
ago I was very interested in knowing how they work and they are designed...

I wanted to know how they think?! do they think at all??? well TO ANSWER THAT!
I am starting a project: Building a Large Language Model from scratch.
